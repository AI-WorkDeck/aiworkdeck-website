User messages, AI replies and reasoning remain as conversation history **until the user deletes the conversation, with no separate automatic expiry**. This includes document text pasted by the user or quoted by the AI. Conversation deletion also removes queue requests and derived summaries and clears document caches; billing usage records remain. Copies already mirrored to a desktop project follow that project's rules and are not remotely erased by deleting the cloud conversation. Earlier versions stored inline bodies in the queue and tool excerpts and summaries in conversation storage. This update removes historical inline bodies from the live request queue. It also removes raw tool excerpts and derived summaries from conversations still identifiable as Office/WPS add-in conversations through their request-source records. Historical conversations without those source records cannot be reliably classified and are not covered by this Office-specific cleanup.
